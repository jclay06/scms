<p><strong><center>1) Why am I here?</strong></center></p><br />
<p><u>Guy:</u> Um, you like web comics, sexual innuendos, and have a desire to see pretty art? Or do you mean that philosophically? Cause I can go on for hours.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> Probably because you either clicked a link or typed in www.thespiffylife.com ... need I say more?</p>

<p><strong><center>2) Who are you guys and what do you do?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> Well, my name is Guy Kopsombut and I&#39;m the artist/writer of the comics. I attend Vanderbilt
University, and major in EE. What you find from the comics is that I&#39;m funny, philosophical, and have a different perspective about life. Or at least I try to show that. Sometimes I just write sex jokes.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> I&#39;m Josh Clayton and I am the WEBMASTER muwuwhahaaa. I make the site and basically everything but the comics. I go to Tennessee Tech University, and also major in EE. A lot of these comics come from our real life encounters and jokes amongst friends.</p>

<p><strong><center>3) Why did you first start drawing the comics?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> I first started drawing the comics to impress a girl, but things didn&#39;t work out. I now draw the comics to release emotions in a healthy manner, question life, and make sex jokes that aren&#39;t deemed suitable while in the public.</p>

<p><strong><center>4) What do you mean the un-pessimistic comic? Shouldn&#39;t that be the optimistic comic?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> Nu-uh. Being optimistic means you view things in the best light. That&#39;s just being na&#239;ve. Pessimism implies that you see things as just plain evil. Thinking like that is a good way to die early. Being un-pessimistic means that you see the world as despicable, but are clever enough to realize that there are also good people in it. That way you can build from the worst parts in life and only find the good. No surprises later on.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> What are you, an English teacher?</p>

<p><strong><center>5) You guys sound a bit emo.</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> I get that a lot, but I&#39;m actually a really happy guy when I&#39;m not thinking. Too bad I think all the time. It&#39;s like I can&#39;t shut my brain box off. I think there is a drug for that. Honestly, I don&#39;t find any appeal to cutting myself or wearing jet black.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> I don&#39;t remember asking you :P ... nah I give my input on some of the comics and maybe my ever-so-slightly difficult life bleeds through sometimes. So what, you wanna fight about it? ;)</p>

<p><strong><center>6) Why are some of your comics really dirty?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> When I was in high school, I was actually really clean in the head. No dirty thoughts nor any cussing. During senior year, I befriend two girls who were much dirtier than I was and, long story short, they corrupted me. They talked about sex all the time and created unheard of innuendos. Eventually, I went to the dark side. THUN THUN THUN!<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> Because it&#39;s friggin&#39; hilarious! Duh? Who doesn&#39;t love a good dirty joke every now and then? I mean really. A once prude, no more haha.</p>

<p><strong><center>7) How do you make the comics?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> I use photoshop dark magic and a wacom tablet to create these works of art.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> I second the magic comment. (if you ask about it we will be forced to kill you ...)</p>

<p><strong><center>8) How long does it take to make a comic?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> Depending on how lazy I am and the length of the comic, 15 minutes to a week. Ya, I&#39;m that lazy.</p>

<p><strong><center>9) How do you make your site?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Josh:</u> Most of the site is some good, fun-loving PHP and MySQL. I learned quite a bit from <a href="http://w3schools.com/" title="learn everything you need about the internet" target="_blank">w3schools</a> and from other sources found on good ole google. I use to solely use Adobe GoLive to code it, but found it slow and they quit supporting it so now I use a program called <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a> on my Mac. I use <a href="http://www.phpbb.com" target="_blank">phpbb3</a> for the <a href="/forum/">forum</a>, and some other open source scripts for the rating system and the polls. If you ask me I might give you a little more info about the site, but I don&#39;t wanna give away too many secrets ;)</p>

<p><strong><center>10) Can I link your comic to my site and you do vice versa?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> As long as you give us credit for the comics and do what we say, you can go ahead and link us. Don&#39;t think that you will make us do the same, though. If you email us your comic or whatever, and we lurrvee it, we&#39;ll link you. Otherwise, no.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> All I gotta say is it better be REALLY funny.</p>

<p><strong><center>11) What is your favorite Disney movie?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> Either Aladdin or the Lion King. There are so many sexual innuendos in them. <span style="font-family: Wingdings"><span>J</span></span><br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> What?</p>

<p><strong><center>12) Your drawing style really changes alot...What the hell?</center></strong></p>
<p><u>Guy:</u> As an artist, I can&#39;t find anything satisfactory, thus, I constantly change things up.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> By that he means he goes from drawing amazingly awesome looking comics that take a long time to drawing stick figures that take 5 minutes because it&#39;s a LOT faster ... you lazy bum :P haha.</p>

<p><strong><center>13) When do you guys update?</center></strong></p>
<p<u>Guy:</u> Whenever I feel like it.<br /><br />
<u>Josh:</u> You wouldn&#39;t have to ask that question if you joined the <a href="/contact/contact.php#form" title="keep in touch">SpiffyAlert Newsletter</a> and/or added our application on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=07456bccc0913897468fa45686700326">FaceBook</a>.</p>
